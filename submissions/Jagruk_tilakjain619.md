## Project Title
Jagruk

## Project Description    
I built the Smart Community Issue Reporting System - a full-stack civic tech platform that empowers citizens to report local issues with GPS tagging, AI-powered categorization, and real-time admin tracking. It’s designed for smart cities and social impact, with features like interactive maps, community voting, and role-based access. The goal: make civic engagement intuitive, transparent, and scalable.

## Inspiration behind the Project  
Most government issue reporting portals are complex, confusing, and slow. Citizens often give up before their complaint even reaches the right department. I’ve seen firsthand how hard it is to report a pothole, broken streetlight, or sanitation issue, and how little feedback people get after submitting. That frustration sparked this project.

I wanted to build something intuitive, transparent, and actually usable. A platform where reporting feels effortless, updates are visible, and communities can rally around shared concerns. Jagruk is my attempt to reimagine civic tech - not as bureaucracy, but as empowerment.

## Tech Stack    
I architected the system using a modern, scalable stack:
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Leaflet Maps, Chart.js
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
- Services: Appwrite (Auth), Cloudinary (Image uploads), OpenRouter AI (categorization), OpenCage (Geocoding)
